But I’m not sure what exactly you’re interested in, in the context of rollups…\n\n\n\nzk_id — 07/25/2023 3:28 PM\nThe part of the rollups seems to be the base for choosing proofs that scale linearly with the amount of nodes (which makes it impractical for large numbers of nodes). The protocol is very simple, and would only need to instead provide constant proofs with the Kate commitments (at the cost of large computational resources is my understanding). This was at least the rationale that I get from reading the paper and the conversation with Bunz, one of the founders of the Espresso shared sequencer (which is where I found the first reference to this paper). I guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal. You still would need the sampling for the light clients though, of course.\n\n\ndryajov — 07/25/2023 8:31 PM\n\nI guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal.\n\nYeah, great question. What follows is strictly IMO, as I haven’t seen this formally contrasted anywhere, so my reasoning can be wrong in subtle ways.\n\n(A)VID - dispersing and storing data in a verifiable manner\nSampling - verifying already dispersed data\n\ntl;dr Sampling allows light nodes to protect against dishonest majority attacks. In other words, a light node cannot be tricked to follow an incorrect chain by a dishonest validator majority that withholds data. More details are here - data-availability-checks.html ------------- First, DAS implies (A)VID, as there is an initial phase where data is distributed to some subset of nodes. Moreover, these nodes, usually the validators, attest that they received the data and that it is correct. If a majority of validators accepts, then the block is considered correct, otherwise it is rejected. This is the verifiable dispersal part. But what if the majority of validators are dishonest? Can you prevent them from tricking the rest of the network from following the chain?\nDankrad Feist\nData availability checks\nPrimer on data availability checks\n\n\n[8:31 PM]\nDealing with dishonest majorities §\nThis is easy if all the data is downloaded by all nodes all the time, but we’re trying to avoid just that. But lets assume, for the sake of the argument, that there are full nodes in the network that download all the data and are able to construct fraud proofs for missing data, can this mitigate the problem? It turns out that it can’t, because proving data (un)availability isn’t a directly attributable fault - in other words, you can observe/detect it but there is no way you can prove it to the rest of the network reliably. More details here A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding So, if there isn’t much that can be done by detecting that a block isn’t available, what good is it for? Well nodes can still avoid following the unavailable chain and thus be tricked by a dishonest majority. However, simply attesting that data has been publishing is not enough to prevent a dishonest majority from attacking the network. (edited)\n\n\ndryajov — 07/25/2023 9:06 PM\nTo complement, the relevant quote from A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding, is:\n\nHere, fraud proofs are not a solution, because not publishing data is not a uniquely attributable fault - in any scheme where a node (“fisherman”) has the ability to “raise the alarm” about some piece of data not being available, if the publisher then publishes the remaining data, all nodes who were not paying attention to that specific piece of data at that exact time cannot determine whether it was the publisher that was maliciously withholding data or whether it was the fisherman that was maliciously making a false alarm.\n\nThe relevant quote from from data-availability-checks.html, is:\n\nThere is one gap in the solution of using fraud proofs to protect light clients from incorrect state transitions: What if a consensus supermajority has signed a block header, but will not publish some of the data (in particular, it could be fraudulent transactions that they will publish later to trick someone into accepting printed/stolen money)? Honest full nodes, obviously, will not follow this chain, as they can’t download the data. But light clients will not know that the data is not available since they don’t try to download the data, only the header. So we are in a situation where the honest full nodes know that something fishy is going on, but they have no means of alerting the light clients, as they are missing the piece of data that might be needed to create a fraud proof.\n\nBoth articles are a bit old, but the intuitions still hold.\n\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\n\nzk_id — 07/26/2023 10:42 AM\nThanks a ton @dryajov !

That’s also my understanding (although surely much more superficial).\n\n\n[4:24 AM]\nThere is also the dimension of computation vs size cost\n\n\n[4:25 AM]\nie the VID scheme (of the paper that kickstarted this conversation) has all the properties we need, but it scales n^2 in message complexity which makes it lose the properties we are looking for after 1k nodes. We need to scale confortably to 10k nodes.\n\n\n[4:29 AM]\nSo we are at the moment most likely to use KZG commitments with a 2d RS polynomial. Basically just copy Ethereum. Reason is:\n\nOur rollups/EZ leader will generate this, and those are beefier machines than the Base Layer. The base layer nodes just need to verify and sign the EC fragments and return them to complete the VID protocol (and then run consensus on the aggregated signed proofs).\nIf we ever decide to change the design for the VID dispersal to be done by Base Layer leaders (in a multileader fashion), it can be distributed (rows/columns can be reconstructed and proven separately). I don’t think we will pursue this, but we will have to if this scheme doesn’t scale with the first option.\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2023\n\n\ndryajov\nA bit scattered all over the place, mainly from @Leobago and @cskiraly @cskiraly has a draft paper somewhere\nLeobago — 08/01/2023 1:13 PM\nNote much public write-ups yet.

Basically just copy Ethereum. Reason is: \n\nOur rollups/EZ leader will generate this, and those are beefier machines than the Base Layer. The base layer nodes just need to verify and sign the EC fragments and return them to complete the VID protocol (and then run consensus on the aggregated signed proofs).\nIf we ever decide to change the design for the VID dispersal to be done by Base Layer leaders (in a multileader fashion), it can be distributed (rows/columns can be reconstructed and proven separately). I don’t think we will pursue this, but we will have to if this scheme doesn’t scale with the first option.\n\ndryajov — 08/01/2023 1:55 PM\nThis might interest you as well - combining-kzg-and-erasure-coding-fc903dc78f1a\nMedium\nCombining KZG and erasure coding\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to Subspace  — Episode II\n\n\n\n\n[1:56 PM]\nThis is a great analysis of the current state of the art in structure of data + commitment and the interplay.

I did not find a JS API for status (maybe I was looking at the wrong places), the closest was the status-js-api project but that still uses whisper and the repo recommends to use js-waku instead  status-js-api Also I also found the 56/STATUS-COMMUNITIES spec: 56 It seems to be quite a complete solution for community management with all the bells and whistles.

Of course you can use the code to figure out things, but at least I would be interested in what are the requirements and high level architecture (does it require an ethereum RPC endpoint, where does it store data, etc.) so that I can evaluate if this is the right approach for me. So maybe a lesson here is to put effort in the documentation and the presentation as well and if you have the budget then have someone on the team whose main responsibility is that (like a devrel or dev evangelist role)\n\n"},"roadmap/innovation_lab/updates/2023-08-11":{"title":"2023-08-17 <TEAM> weekly","links":[],"tags":["team-updates"],"content":"Logos Lab 11th of August §\nCurrently working on the Waku Objects prototype, which is a modular system for transactional chat objects.\nWe merged the group chat but it surfaced plenty of issues that were not a problem with 1on1 chats, both with our Waku integration and from product perspective as well.
