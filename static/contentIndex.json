Most of the configuration you should need can be done by just editing quartz.config.ts or changing the layout in quartz.layout.ts.\n\n\n                  \n                  Tip \n                  \n                \nIf you edit Quartz configuration using a text-editor that has TypeScript language support like VSCode, it will warn you when you you’ve made an error in your configuration, helping you avoid configuration mistakes!\n\nThe configuration of Quartz can be broken down into two main parts:\nquartz.config.tsconst config: QuartzConfig = {\n  configuration: { ... },\n  plugins: { ... },\n}\nGeneral Configuration §\nThis part of the configuration concerns anything that can affect the whole site. The following is a list breaking down all the things you can configure:\n\npageTitle: title of the site. This is also used when generating the RSS Feed for your site.\nenableSPA: whether to enable SPA Routing on your site.\nenablePopovers: whether to enable popover previews on your site.\nanalytics: what to use for analytics on your site. Values can be\n\nnull: don’t use analytics;\n{ provider: &#039;plausible&#039; }: use Plausible, a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics; or\n{ provider: &#039;google&#039;, tagId: &lt;your-google-tag&gt; }: use Google Analytics\n\n\nbaseUrl: this is used for sitemaps and RSS feeds that require an absolute URL to know where the canonical ‘home’ of your site lives. This is normally the deployed URL of your site (e.g. quartz.jzhao.xyz for this site). Do not include the protocol (i.e. https://) or any leading or trailing slashes.\n\nThis should also include the subpath if you are hosting on GitHub pages without a custom domain. For example, if my repository is jackyzha0/quartz, GitHub pages would deploy to https://jackyzha0.github.io/quartz and the baseUrl would be jackyzha0.github.io/quartz\nNote that Quartz 4 will avoid using this as much as possible and use relative URLs whenever it can to make sure your site works no matter where you end up actually deploying it.\n\n\nignorePatterns: a list of glob patterns that Quartz should ignore and not search through when looking for files inside the content folder. See private pages for more details.\ntheme: configure how the site looks.\n\ntypography: what fonts to use. Any font available on Google Fonts works here.\n\nheader: Font to use for headers\ncode: Font for inline and block quotes.\nbody: Font for everything\n\n\ncolors: controls the theming of the site.\n\nlight: page background\nlightgray: borders\ngray: graph links, heavier borders\ndarkgray: body text\ndark: header text and icons\nsecondary: link colour, current graph node\ntertiary: hover states and visited graph nodes\nhighlight: internal link background, highlighted text, highlighted lines of code\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugins §\nYou can think of Quartz plugins as a series of transformations over content.\n\nplugins: {\n  transformers: [...],\n  filters: [...],\n  emitters: [...],\n}\n\nTransformers map over content (e.g. parsing frontmatter, generating a description)\nFilters filter content (e.g. filtering out drafts)\nEmitters reduce over content (e.g. creating an RSS feed or pages that list all files with a specific tag)\n\nBy adding, removing, and reordering plugins from the tranformers, filters, and emitters fields, you can customize the behaviour of Quartz.\n\n\n                  \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nEach node is modified by every transformer in order. Some transformers are position-sensitive so you may need to take special note of whether it needs come before or after any other particular plugins.\n\nAdditionally, plugins may also have their own configuration settings that you can pass in. For example, the Latex plugin allows you to pass in a field specifying the renderEngine to choose between Katex and MathJax.\ntransformers: [\n  Plugin.FrontMatter(), // uses default options\n  Plugin.Latex({ renderEngine: &quot;katex&quot; }), // specify some options\n]\nIf you’d like to make your own plugins, read the guide on making plugins for more information."},"hosting":{"title":"Hosting","links":["RSS-Feed","configuration"],"tags":[],"content":"Quartz effectively turns your Markdown files and other resources into a bundle of HTML, JS, and CSS files (a website!).\nHowever, if you’d like to publish your site to the world, you need a way to host it online. This guide will detail how to deploy with either GitHub Pages or Cloudflare pages but any service that allows you to deploy static HTML should work as well (e.g. Netlify, Replit, etc.)\n\n\n                  \n                  Tip \n                  \n                \nSome Quartz features (like RSS Feed and sitemap generation) require baseUrl to be configured properly in your configuration to work properly. Make sure you set this before deploying!\n\nCloudflare Pages §\n\nLog in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.\nIn Account Home, select Workers &amp; Pages &gt; Create application &gt; Pages &gt; Connect to Git.\nSelect the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the Set up builds and deployments section, provide the following information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration optionValueProduction branchv4Framework presetNoneBuild commandnpx quartz buildBuild output directorypublic\nPress “Save and deploy” and Cloudflare should have a deployed version of your site in about a minute. Then, every time you sync your Quartz changes to GitHub, your site should be updated.\nTo add a custom domain, check out Cloudflare’s documentation.\nGitHub Pages §\nLike Quartz 3, you can deploy the site generated by Quartz 4 via GitHub Pages.\nIn your local Quartz, create a new file quartz/.github/workflows/deploy.yml.\nquartz/.github/workflows/deploy.ymlname: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages\n \non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - v4\n \npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  pages: write\n  id-token: write\n \nconcurrency:\n  group: &quot;pages&quot;\n  cancel-in-progress: false\n \njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for git info\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 18.14\n      - name: Install Dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n      - name: Build Quartz\n        run: npx quartz build\n      - name: Upload artifact\n        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          path: public\n \n  deploy:\n    needs: build\n    environment:\n      name: github-pages\n      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n        id: deployment\n        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2\nThen:\n\nHead to “Settings” tab of your forked repository and in the sidebar, click “Pages”. Under “Source”, select “GitHub Actions”.\nCommit these changes by doing npx quartz sync. This should deploy your site to &lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Tip \n                  \n                \nIf you get an error about not being allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules, make sure you remove any existing GitHub pages environments.\nYou can do this by going to your Settings page on your GitHub fork and going to the Environments tab and pressing the trash icon. The GitHub action will recreate the environment for you correctly the next time you sync your Quartz.\n\nCustom Domain §\nHere’s how to add a custom domain to your GitHub pages deployment.\n\nHead to the “Settings” tab of your forked repository.\nIn the “Code and automation” section of the sidebar, click “Pages”.\nUnder “Custom Domain”, type your custom domain and click “Save”.\nThis next step depends on whether you are using an apex domain (example.com) or a subdomain (subdomain.example.com).\n\nIf you are using an apex domain, navigate to your DNS provider and create an A record that points your apex domain to GitHub’s name servers which have the following IP addresses:\n\n185.199.108.153\n185.199.109.153\n185.199.110.153\n185.199.111.153\n\n\nIf you are using a subdomain, navigate to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points your subdomain to the default domain for your site. For example, if you want to use the subdomain quartz.example.com for your user site, create a CNAME record that points quartz.example.com to &lt;github-username&gt;.github.io.\n\n\n\nThe above shows a screenshot of Google Domains configured for both jzhao.xyz (an apex domain) and quartz.jzhao.xyz (a subdomain).\nSee the GitHub documentation for more detail about how to setup your own custom domain with GitHub Pages.\n\n\n                  \n                  Why aren&#039;t my changes showing up? \n                  \n                \nThere could be many different reasons why your changes aren’t showing up but the most likely reason is that you forgot to push your changes to GitHub.\nMake sure you save your changes to Git and sync it to GitHub by doing npx quartz sync. This will also make sure to pull any updates you may have made from other devices so you have them locally.\n"},"index":{"title":"","links":["roadmap/waku/overview","roadmap/codex/overview","roadmap/nomos/overview","roadmap/vac/overview","roadmap/innovation_lab/overview","roadmap/acid/overview"],"tags":[],"content":"This site attempts to inform the previous, current, and future work required to fulfill the requirements of the projects under the Logos Collective, a complete tech stack that provides infrastructure for the self-sovereign network state.

To enable easy customization, these emitters allow you to fully rearrange the layout of the page. The default page layouts can be found in quartz.layout.ts.\nEach page is composed of multiple different sections which contain QuartzComponents. The following code snippet lists all of the valid sections that you can add components to:\nquartz/cfg.tsexport interface FullPageLayout {\n  head: QuartzComponent // single component\n  header: QuartzComponent[] // laid out horizontally\n  beforeBody: QuartzComponent[] // laid out vertically\n  pageBody: QuartzComponent // single component\n  left: QuartzComponent[] // vertical on desktop, horizontal on mobile\n  right: QuartzComponent[] // vertical on desktop, horizontal on mobile\n  footer: QuartzComponent // single component\n}\nThese correspond to following parts of the page:\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nThere are two additional layout fields that are not shown in the above diagram.\n\nhead is a single component that renders the &lt;head&gt; tag in the HTML. This doesn’t appear visually on the page and is only is responsible for metadata about the document like the tab title, scripts, and styles.\nheader is a set of components that are laid out horizontally and appears before the beforeBody section. This enables you to replicate the old Quartz 3 header bar where the title, search bar, and dark mode toggle. By default, Quartz 4 doesn’t place any components in the header.\n\n\nQuartz components, like plugins, can take in additional properties as configuration options. If you’re familiar with React terminology, you can think of them as Higher-order Components.\nSee a list of all the components for all available components along with their configuration options. You can also checkout the guide on creating components if you’re interested in further customizing the behaviour of Quartz.\nStyle §\nMost meaningful style changes like colour scheme and font can be done simply through the general configuration options. However, if you’d like to make more involved style changes, you can do this by writing your own styles. Quartz 4, like Quartz 3, uses Sass for styling.\nYou can see the base style sheet in quartz/styles/base.scss and write your own in quartz/styles/custom.scss.\n\n\n                  \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nSome components may provide their own styling as well! For example, quartz/components/Darkmode.tsx imports styles from quartz/components/styles/darkmode.scss. If you’d like to customize styling for a specific component, double check the component definition to see how its styles are defined.\n"},"migrating-from-Quartz-3":{"title":"Migrating from Quartz 3","links":["configuration","hosting","folder-and-tag-listings","creating-components"],"tags":[],"content":"As you already have Quartz locally, you don’t need to fork or clone it again.

Quartz 4 now uses a Node-based static-site generation process which should lead to a much more helpful error messages and an overall smoother user experience.\nFull-hot reload: The many rough edges of how hugo-obsidian integrated with Hugo meant that watch mode didn’t re-trigger hugo-obsidian to update the content index. This lead to a lot of weird cases where the watch mode output wasn’t accurate. Quartz 4 now uses a cohesive parse, filter, and emit pipeline which gets run on every change so hot-reloads are always accurate.\nReplacing Go template syntax with JSX: Quartz 3 used Go templates to create layouts for pages. However, the syntax isn’t great for doing any sort of complex rendering (like text processing) and it got very difficult to make any meaningful layout changes to Quartz 3. Quartz 4 uses an extension of JavaScript syntax called JSX which allows you to write layout code that looks like HTML in JavaScript which is significantly easier to understand and maintain.\nA new extensible configuration and plugin system: Quartz 3 was hard to configure without technical knowledge of how Hugo’s partials worked. Extensions were even hard to make. Quartz 4’s configuration and plugin system is designed to be extended by users while making updating to new versions of Quartz easy.\n\nThings to update §\n\nYou will need to update your deploy scripts. See the hosting guide for more details.\nEnsure that your default branch on GitHub is updated from hugo to v4.\nFolder and tag listings have also changed.\n\nFolder descriptions should go under content/&lt;folder-name&gt;/index.md where &lt;folder-name&gt; is the name of the folder.\nTag descriptions should go under content/tags/&lt;tag-name&gt;.md where &lt;tag-name&gt; is the name of the tag.\n\n\nSome HTML layout may not be the same between Quartz 3 and Quartz 4. If you depended on a particular HTML hierarchy or class names, you may need to update your custom CSS to reflect these changes.\nIf you customized the layout of Quartz 3, you may need to translate these changes from Go templates back to JSX as Quartz 4 no longer uses Hugo. For components, check out the guide on creating components for more details on this.\n"},"philosophy":{"title":"Philosophy of Quartz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A garden should be a true hypertext §\n\nThe garden is the web as topology. Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships.\n(The Garden and the Stream)\n\nThe problem with the file cabinet is that it focuses on efficiency of access and interoperability rather than generativity and creativity. Thinking is not linear, nor is it hierarchical. In fact, not many things are linear or hierarchical at all. Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological or hierarchical order for my thought processes? The ideal tool for thought for me would embrace the messiness of my mind, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order. A rhizomatic, not arboresecent, form of note taking.\nMy goal with a digital garden is not purely as an organizing system and information store (though it works nicely for that). I want my digital garden to be a playground for new ways ideas can connect together. As a result, existing formal organizing systems like Zettelkasten or the hierarchical folder structures of Notion don’t work well for me. There is way too much upfront friction that by the time I’ve thought about how to organize my thought into folders categories, I’ve lost it.\nQuartz embraces the inherent rhizomatic and web-like nature of our thinking and tries to encourage note-taking in a similar form.\n\nA garden should be shared §\nThe goal of digital gardening should be to tap into your network’s collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops. If done well, I have a shareable representation of my thoughts that I can send out into the world and people can respond. Even for my most half-baked thoughts, this helps me create a feedback cycle to strengthen and fully flesh out that idea.\nQuartz is designed first and foremost as a tool for publishing digital gardens to the web. To me, digital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. It’s a form of expression and sharing.\n\n“[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.”\n— Richard Hamming\n\nThe goal of Quartz is to make sharing your digital garden free and simple. At its core, Quartz is designed to be easy to use enough for non-technical people to get going but also powerful enough that senior developers can tweak it to work how they’d like it to work."},"showcase":{"title":"Quartz Showcase","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Want to see what Quartz can do?

But I’m not sure what exactly you’re interested in, in the context of rollups…\n\n\n\nzk_id — 07/25/2023 3:28 PM\nThe part of the rollups seems to be the base for choosing proofs that scale linearly with the amount of nodes (which makes it impractical for large numbers of nodes). The protocol is very simple, and would only need to instead provide constant proofs with the Kate commitments (at the cost of large computational resources is my understanding). This was at least the rationale that I get from reading the paper and the conversation with Bunz, one of the founders of the Espresso shared sequencer (which is where I found the first reference to this paper). I guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal. You still would need the sampling for the light clients though, of course.\n\n\ndryajov — 07/25/2023 8:31 PM\n\nI guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal.\n\nYeah, great question. What follows is strictly IMO, as I haven’t seen this formally contrasted anywhere, so my reasoning can be wrong in subtle ways.\n\n(A)VID - dispersing and storing data in a verifiable manner\nSampling - verifying already dispersed data\n\ntl;dr Sampling allows light nodes to protect against dishonest majority attacks. In other words, a light node cannot be tricked to follow an incorrect chain by a dishonest validator majority that withholds data. More details are here - data-availability-checks.html ------------- First, DAS implies (A)VID, as there is an initial phase where data is distributed to some subset of nodes. Moreover, these nodes, usually the validators, attest that they received the data and that it is correct. If a majority of validators accepts, then the block is considered correct, otherwise it is rejected. This is the verifiable dispersal part. But what if the majority of validators are dishonest? Can you prevent them from tricking the rest of the network from following the chain?\nDankrad Feist\nData availability checks\nPrimer on data availability checks\n\n\n[8:31 PM]\nDealing with dishonest majorities §\nThis is easy if all the data is downloaded by all nodes all the time, but we’re trying to avoid just that. But lets assume, for the sake of the argument, that there are full nodes in the network that download all the data and are able to construct fraud proofs for missing data, can this mitigate the problem? It turns out that it can’t, because proving data (un)availability isn’t a directly attributable fault - in other words, you can observe/detect it but there is no way you can prove it to the rest of the network reliably. More details here A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding So, if there isn’t much that can be done by detecting that a block isn’t available, what good is it for? Well nodes can still avoid following the unavailable chain and thus be tricked by a dishonest majority. However, simply attesting that data has been publishing is not enough to prevent a dishonest majority from attacking the network. (edited)\n\n\ndryajov — 07/25/2023 9:06 PM\nTo complement, the relevant quote from A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding, is:\n\nHere, fraud proofs are not a solution, because not publishing data is not a uniquely attributable fault - in any scheme where a node (“fisherman”) has the ability to “raise the alarm” about some piece of data not being available, if the publisher then publishes the remaining data, all nodes who were not paying attention to that specific piece of data at that exact time cannot determine whether it was the publisher that was maliciously withholding data or whether it was the fisherman that was maliciously making a false alarm.\n\nThe relevant quote from from data-availability-checks.html, is:\n\nThere is one gap in the solution of using fraud proofs to protect light clients from incorrect state transitions: What if a consensus supermajority has signed a block header, but will not publish some of the data (in particular, it could be fraudulent transactions that they will publish later to trick someone into accepting printed/stolen money)? Honest full nodes, obviously, will not follow this chain, as they can’t download the data. But light clients will not know that the data is not available since they don’t try to download the data, only the header. So we are in a situation where the honest full nodes know that something fishy is going on, but they have no means of alerting the light clients, as they are missing the piece of data that might be needed to create a fraud proof.\n\nBoth articles are a bit old, but the intuitions still hold.\n\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\n\nzk_id — 07/26/2023 10:42 AM\nThanks a ton @dryajov !

I did not find a JS API for status (maybe I was looking at the wrong places), the closest was the status-js-api project but that still uses whisper and the repo recommends to use js-waku instead  status-js-api Also I also found the 56/STATUS-COMMUNITIES spec: 56 It seems to be quite a complete solution for community management with all the bells and whistles. However our use case is a private group chat for your existing contacts, so it seems to be a bit overkill for that.\n\n\nfryorcraken — Today at 5:32 AM\nThe repo is status-im/status-web\n\n\n[5:33 AM]\nSpec is 55\n\n\nfryorcraken\nThe repo is status-im/status-web\n\n\nattila🍀 — Today at 6:05 AM\nAs constructive feedback I can tell you that it is not trivial to find it and use it in other projects It is presented as a React component without documentation and by looking at the code it seems to provide you the whole chat UI of the desktop app, which is not necessarily what you need if you want to embed it in your app It seems to be using this package: js Which also does not have documentation I assume that package is built from this: status-js This looks promising, but again there is no documentation. Of course you can use the code to figure out things, but at least I would be interested in what are the requirements and high level architecture (does it require an ethereum RPC endpoint, where does it store data, etc.) so that I can evaluate if this is the right approach for me. So maybe a lesson here is to put effort in the documentation and the presentation as well and if you have the budget then have someone on the team whose main responsibility is that (like a devrel or dev evangelist role)\n\n"},"roadmap/innovation_lab/updates/2023-08-11":{"title":"2023-08-17 <TEAM> weekly","links":[],"tags":["team-updates"],"content":"Logos Lab 11th of August §\nCurrently working on the Waku Objects prototype, which is a modular system for transactional chat objects.\nWe merged the group chat but it surfaced plenty of issues that were not a problem with 1on1 chats, both with our Waku integration and from product perspective as well.
