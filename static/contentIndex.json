But I’m not sure what exactly you’re interested in, in the context of rollups…\n\n\n\nzk_id — 07/25/2023 3:28 PM\nThe part of the rollups seems to be the base for choosing proofs that scale linearly with the amount of nodes (which makes it impractical for large numbers of nodes). The protocol is very simple, and would only need to instead provide constant proofs with the Kate commitments (at the cost of large computational resources is my understanding). This was at least the rationale that I get from reading the paper and the conversation with Bunz, one of the founders of the Espresso shared sequencer (which is where I found the first reference to this paper). I guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal. You still would need the sampling for the light clients though, of course.\n\n\ndryajov — 07/25/2023 8:31 PM\n\nI guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal.\n\nYeah, great question. What follows is strictly IMO, as I haven’t seen this formally contrasted anywhere, so my reasoning can be wrong in subtle ways.\n\n(A)VID - dispersing and storing data in a verifiable manner\nSampling - verifying already dispersed data\n\ntl;dr Sampling allows light nodes to protect against dishonest majority attacks. In other words, a light node cannot be tricked to follow an incorrect chain by a dishonest validator majority that withholds data. More details are here - data-availability-checks.html ------------- First, DAS implies (A)VID, as there is an initial phase where data is distributed to some subset of nodes. Moreover, these nodes, usually the validators, attest that they received the data and that it is correct. If a majority of validators accepts, then the block is considered correct, otherwise it is rejected. This is the verifiable dispersal part. But what if the majority of validators are dishonest? Can you prevent them from tricking the rest of the network from following the chain?\nDankrad Feist\nData availability checks\nPrimer on data availability checks\n\n\n[8:31 PM]\nDealing with dishonest majorities §\nThis is easy if all the data is downloaded by all nodes all the time, but we’re trying to avoid just that. But lets assume, for the sake of the argument, that there are full nodes in the network that download all the data and are able to construct fraud proofs for missing data, can this mitigate the problem? It turns out that it can’t, because proving data (un)availability isn’t a directly attributable fault - in other words, you can observe/detect it but there is no way you can prove it to the rest of the network reliably. More details here A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding So, if there isn’t much that can be done by detecting that a block isn’t available, what good is it for? Well nodes can still avoid following the unavailable chain and thus be tricked by a dishonest majority. However, simply attesting that data has been publishing is not enough to prevent a dishonest majority from attacking the network. (edited)\n\n\ndryajov — 07/25/2023 9:06 PM\nTo complement, the relevant quote from A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding, is:\n\nHere, fraud proofs are not a solution, because not publishing data is not a uniquely attributable fault - in any scheme where a node (“fisherman”) has the ability to “raise the alarm” about some piece of data not being available, if the publisher then publishes the remaining data, all nodes who were not paying attention to that specific piece of data at that exact time cannot determine whether it was the publisher that was maliciously withholding data or whether it was the fisherman that was maliciously making a false alarm.\n\nThe relevant quote from from data-availability-checks.html, is:\n\nThere is one gap in the solution of using fraud proofs to protect light clients from incorrect state transitions: What if a consensus supermajority has signed a block header, but will not publish some of the data (in particular, it could be fraudulent transactions that they will publish later to trick someone into accepting printed/stolen money)? Honest full nodes, obviously, will not follow this chain, as they can’t download the data. But light clients will not know that the data is not available since they don’t try to download the data, only the header. So we are in a situation where the honest full nodes know that something fishy is going on, but they have no means of alerting the light clients, as they are missing the piece of data that might be needed to create a fraud proof.\n\nBoth articles are a bit old, but the intuitions still hold.\n\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\n\nzk_id — 07/26/2023 10:42 AM\nThanks a ton @dryajov !

Of course you can use the code to figure out things, but at least I would be interested in what are the requirements and high level architecture (does it require an ethereum RPC endpoint, where does it store data, etc.) so that I can evaluate if this is the right approach for me.

Iterations on spec parlance and further enhancements will be covered in future milestones.\nThe goal we want to aim for is to take down and completely get rid of specs.status.im and its accompanying repo specs , so that all Status protocol specs are in the rfc repo\nTasks:\n\ndetermine which specs from specs.status.im are still relevant as protocol specs, and which old specs are no longer relevant and can be discarded\nout of the still relevant protocol specs that haven’t yet been moved over to the Vac RFC repo, update these specs as needed and move them into the Vac RFC repo\nonce done, take down specs.status.im and archive the rfc repo\n\nThe new Status website will have a ‘Specs’ section inside the ‘Developers’ part of the website, and this Specs section will pull in and render all specs from rfc.vac.dev with “STATUS-” in their title.\nNote that feature specs should NOT be added to the Vac RFC repo, only protocol specs should go here.\nRFCs to be moved / updates:\n\n(todo add RFCs we already ported)\n6/PAYLOADS (needs significant update)\n2/ACCOUNT\n16/Keycard (discuss with keycard team)\n16/Push-Notifications (raw, needs update)\n10/waku-usage (outdated, check if we need that, update to Waku 2 if makes sense)\n\nout of scope? §\n\n14/Dapp browser API usage (this is not part of chat SDK, is this still a RFC? API doc would be more fitting here.)\n13/3RD-PARTY (investigate, most likely out-of-scope as it is not a protocol spec)\n8/EIPS (clarify if we have to port this → this should not be an RFC, needs constant updates, link EIPS in RFCs where needed)\n\nstable - deprecated §\n(just copy these; confirm this is OK)\n\n4/whisper-mailserver\n11/Waku-Mailserver\n\nJustification §\nDeliverables §\n\n53\n54\n55\n56\n61\n"},"vac/sc/g/codex/review-codex-contracts":{"title":"Review Codex Contracts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"vac:sc::codex:review-codex-contracts §\n\n%%{ \n  init: { \n    &#039;theme&#039;: &#039;base&#039;, \n    &#039;themeVariables&#039;: { \n      &#039;primaryColor&#039;: &#039;#BB2528&#039;, \n      &#039;primaryTextColor&#039;: &#039;#fff&#039;, \n      &#039;primaryBorderColor&#039;: &#039;#7C0000&#039;, \n      &#039;lineColor&#039;: &#039;#F8B229&#039;, \n      &#039;secondaryColor&#039;: &#039;#006100&#039;, \n      &#039;tertiaryColor&#039;: &#039;#fff&#039;
