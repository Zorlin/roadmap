**Claro** (formerly Glacier) is a consensus candidate for the Logos network that aims to be an improvement to the Avalanche family of consensus protocols. 


### Implementations
The protocol has been implemented in multiple languages to facilitate learning and testing. The individual code repositories can be found in the following links:
- Rust (reference)
- Python
- Common Lisp

### Simulations/Experiments/Analysis
In order to test the performance of the protocol, and how it stacked up to the Avalanche family of protocols, we have performed a multitude of simulations and experiments under various assumptions. 
- [Alvaro's initial Python implementations and simulation code](https://github.com/status-im/consensus-models)

### Specification
Currently the Claro consensus protocol is being drafted into a specification so that other implementations can be created. It's draft resides under [Vac](https://vac.dev) and can be tracked [here](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc/pull/512/)
