Consensus is the foundation of the network. It is how a group of peer-to-peer nodes understands how to agree on information in a distributed way, particuluarly in the presence of byzantine actors. 

## Consensus Roadmap
### Consensus Candidates
- [Carnot](roadmap/consensus/candidates/carnot/overview.md) - Carnot is the current leading consensus candidate for the Nomos network. It is designed to maximize efficiency of message dissemination while supoorting hundreds of thousands of full validators. It gets its name from the thermodynamic concept of the [Carnot Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle), which defines maximal efficiency of work from heat through iterative gas expansions and contractions. 
- [Claro](roadmap/consensus/candidates/claro.md) - Claro is a variant of the Avalanche Snow family of protocols, designed to be more efficient at the decision making process by leveraging the concept of "confidence" across peer responses.
