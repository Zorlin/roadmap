Types:
        1: A Block has the following fields:
        parent
        view
        qc
        aggQC
        signature
        transactions
        randomseed  #Provides the proof for being the leader of the round. This field may not be needed if the qc is used to generate the random seed.
        
        
        
        2: A vote has the following fields:
        block hash
        view 
        signer
        signature
        
        
        3: A QC has the following fields:
        block       # Hash of a block is used in this field as a representative of the actual block.
        view
        signers
        signature
        Type
        

        4: An aggQC has the following fields:
        qcs
        view
        signers
        signature


Local Variables:
        highQC
        curView
        latestCommittedBlock



Utilities:
     leader (randseed): returns the leader of the view
     reset(): resets timer. If the timer expires a node times out
     extends(block, ancestor): returns true if block is descendant of the ancestor in the chain.



#Core Functions of the Carnot consensus:

        Func safeBlock(block){
	        if block.QC != Null{
		        return block.view >= curView and block.view == block.qc.block.view + 1
                }
	        if block.aggQC != Null{
		        return block.view >= curView and extends(block, block.aggQC.highQC.block)

                }
        }
